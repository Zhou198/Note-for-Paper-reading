Two general strategies are used to tacke multicategory classification problems with SVMS: 1) Constructing pairwise (1-versus-1) binary SVMs. So there are ${C_k^2}=k(k-1)$ binary SVMs. However, this approach will potentially increase the variance since it use less observations in each SVM. Moreover, the total number of binary classifiers gets more and more with increasinf $k$.
